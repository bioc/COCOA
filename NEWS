# Change log
Notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] -- Unreleased

    - Major changes to user interface: parameter/function/output column name changes
        - loadingMat => signal
        - PCsToAnnotate => signalCols?
        - genomicSignal => 
        - orderByPC => orderByCol
        - regionGR => regionSet (some functions already had regionSet param)
        - pcScores => sampleScores
        - signalAlongPC => signalAlongVariable?
        - cytosine_coverage (column name in output of runCOCOA()) => signalCoverage
        - region_coverage (column name in ouput of runCOCOA())=> regionSetCoverage
    - Addition of functionality for region-based data such as ATAC-seq
    - Other changes
        - absVal parameter added for several functions

## [1.0.2] -- 2019-03-06

    - Bug fix: getLoadingProfile() had error when no overlap between signalCoord and regionSet. Now returns NULL in that case.
    - Bug fix: rsRankingIndex() was sorting NA's to the top of results. This is confusing when selecting top region sets for further analysis or visualization. Now NA's are sorted to the bottom.
    - Bug fix: rsScoreHeatmap() also was sorting NA's to the top of results, which resulted in potentially excluding the real top region sets from the plot. Now NA's are sorted to the bottom.

## [0.99.9] -- 2018-10-29

    - First release version
    - Name changed to COCOA from PCRSA (Principal Component Region Set Analysis)
    - Other changes to UI including function names and parameters

## [0.99.0] -- 2018-09-05

    - Submitted to Bioconductor
