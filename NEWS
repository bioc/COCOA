## [2.0.0] -- Unreleased

    - Major changes to user interface: parameter/function/output column name changes
        - loadingMat => signal
        - PCsToAnnotate => signalCol
        - orderByPC => orderByCol
        - regionGR => regionSet (some functions already had regionSet param)
        - pcScores => sampleScores
        - signalAlongPC => signalAlongAxis
        - cytosine_coverage (column name in output of runCOCOA()) => signalCoverage
        - region_coverage (column name in output of runCOCOA())=> regionSetCoverage
        - aggregateLoadings => aggregateSignal
        - getLoadingProfile => getMetaRegionProfile
        - total_region_number => totalRegionNumber
        - mean_region_size => meanRegionSize
        - new column added to output of runCOCOA (only for multi-base data): sumProportionOverlap
    - Addition of functionality for region-based data such as ATAC-seq
        - default setting automatically detects whether data is single base(e.g. DNA methylation or multiple bases like ATAC-seq.
        - different scoring method for single base vs multiple base data
    - New functions that enable supervised (and unsupervised) analysis
	- 
    - Other changes
        - absVal parameter added for several functions (aggregateLoadings, getLoadingProfile, runCOCOA)
        - getMetaRegionProfile: default binNum changed from 25 to 21
	- wilcoxon rank sum scoring method deprecated

## [1.0.2] -- 2019-03-06

    - Bug fix: getLoadingProfile() had error when no overlap between signalCoord and regionSet. Now returns NULL in that case.
    - Bug fix: rsRankingIndex() was sorting NA's to the top of results. This is confusing when selecting top region sets for further analysis or visualization. Now NA's are sorted to the bottom.
    - Bug fix: rsScoreHeatmap() also was sorting NA's to the top of results, which resulted in potentially excluding the real top region sets from the plot. Now NA's are sorted to the bottom.

## [0.99.9] -- 2018-10-29

    - First release version
    - Name changed to COCOA from PCRSA (Principal Component Region Set Analysis)
    - Other changes to UI including function names and parameters

## [0.99.0] -- 2018-09-05

    - Submitted to Bioconductor
