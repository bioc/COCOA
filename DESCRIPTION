Title: Principal Component Region Set Analysis
Description: A method for annotating principal components of DNA methylation data with region sets. A region set is a set of genomic regions that share a biological annotation. PCRSA can identify biologically meaningful sources of variation along the PCs, increasing interpretability of the PCs and understanding of variation in the data.
