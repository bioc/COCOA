\usage{
rsScoreHeatmap(rsScores, signalCol = paste0("PC", 1:5),
  orderByCol = "PC1", rsNameCol = "rsName", topX = 20,
  col = c("red", "#EEEEEE", "blue"), row_title = "Region Set",
  column_title = "Principal Component", column_title_side = "bottom",
  cluster_rows = FALSE, cluster_columns = FALSE,
  show_row_names = TRUE, row_names_max_width = unit(10000, "mm"),
  name = "Rank within PC", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{rsScores}{data.frame. A data.frame with region set
scores. The output of the 'runCOCOA' function.
Each row is a region set. One column for each sample
variable of interest (e.g. PC or sample phenotype).
Also can have columns with info on the overlap between the 
region set and the epigenetic data. 
Rows should be in the same order as the region sets in GRList
(the list of region sets used to create rsScores.)}

\item{signalCol}{A character vector with the sample variables
of interest (e.g. PCs or sample phenotypes). 


Must be column names of rsScores.
e.g. c("PC1", "PC2")}

\item{orderByCol}{a character object. PC to order by in heatmap 
(arranged in decreasing order for scores so p values should 
be -log transformed). Must be the name of a column in rsScores.}

\item{rsNameCol}{character. Name of the column in rsScores that has the
names/identifiers for the region sets so these can be included 
in the plot as row names.}

\item{topX}{Number of top region sets to include in the heatmap}

\item{col}{a vector of colors or a color mapping function which
will be passed to the ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap() function. See ?Heatmap
(the "col" parameter) for more details. "#EEEEEE" is the code for a
color similar to white.}

\item{row_title}{character object, row title}

\item{column_title}{character object, column title}

\item{column_title_side}{character object, where to put the column title:
"top" or "bottom"}

\item{cluster_rows}{"logical" object, whether rows should be clustered. 
This should be kept as FALSE to keep the correct ranking of region sets.}

\item{cluster_columns}{"logical" object, whether to cluster columns. It is recommended
to keep this as FALSE so it will be easier to compare PCs 
(with cluster_columns = FALSE, they will be in the same specified
order in different heatmaps)}

\item{show_row_names}{"logical" object, display row names (ie region set names)}

\item{row_names_max_width}{"unit" object. The amount of room to 
allocate for row names. See ?grid::unit for object type.}

\item{name}{character object, legend title}

\item{...}{optional parameters for ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap().}
}
\value{
A heatmap of region set scores across. Each row is a region set,
each column is a PC. The color corresponds to the relative rank of a 
region set's score for a given PC out of all tested region sets.
}
\description{
Heatmap of the ranking of region set scores across PCs
A visualization of the rank of region sets in each PC, allowing the
user to see if a region set is ranked highly in all PCs or only a subset.
Region sets will be ranked from highest scoring to lowest based on 
their score for `orderByCol`.
The ComplexHeatmap package
is used and additional parameters for the ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap function
may be passed to this function to modify the heatmap.
